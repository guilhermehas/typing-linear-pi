\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We present the syntax, operational semantics, and typing rules for a \picalc{} with linear and shared types. We use leftover typing \cite{} to encode our typing rules. We build framing and weakening proofs that we then use to prove subject congruence and subject reduction.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Intensional (correct by construction) vs extensional

same syntax and semantics, different typing rules

\subsection{Contribution}

machine verified formalisation of the pi calculus

typing with leftovers applied to the pi calculus

unique quirks: multiple multiplicities per variable, shared types

full formalisation available in Agda

\section{Related work}

\cite{previous-work} polymorphic tokens, HOAS

\cite{typing-with-leftovers}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Syntax}

variable references (strings, locally named, de Bruijn)

strings to maybe de Bruijn

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Semantics}

keeping track of the variable on which communication occurs

\section{Linear typing rules}

\subsection{Variable references}

\begin{description}
  \item[Polarities]
  \item[Multiple variables]
  \item[Vectors]
    Most general solution, $n$ possible multiplicities
\end{description}

\subsection{Multiplicities}

Generalisation over indexed sets of monoids

$\inf$ and $\mathbb{N}$ as generalisations

properties of the underlaying monoid

\subsubsection{Total definition}

\subsubsection{Partial definition}

partial vs total

\subsection{Variable types and multiplicities}

two-layered approach: types on one hand, capabilities on the other
removing from context vs keeping in context but marking it used

\subsection{Typing with leftovers}

\subsubsection{Typing relation}

Variable references as proofs of capability

Context splits at each variable reference

\section{Subject reduction}

\subsection{Framing}

Definition
Let $\Gamma \type P \boxtimes \Delta$ and $\Gamma - Delta \equiv \Xi - \phi$.
Then $\Xi \type P \boxtimes \phi$.

By defining of $\uplus$ as a total function, $\Gamma - \Delta$ is no longer
functional: $\omega - \omega$ results in any multiplicity, including $0$. Therefore
$\Xi \type P \boxtimes \phi$ would imply that such a variable cannot appear in $P$.

\subsection{Weakening}

\section{Future work}

Work that will be done time permiting:

Decidable typechecking

Proof of progress

Product types

Sum types

Encoding of session types
